# A_N_T_I
a small C++ shmup game
feel free to have a look.
C++ project, make sure you have a g++ compiler. Code should work for both Windows and Linux (mostly tested on Linux)
compile by copy and pasting the lines on compiling_shortcut.txt on the terminal inside one of the folder's versions.

New version with more features on v.1_0. Probably game will never be done until 10_0 lol
If you'd like to mess around with the code, enter the savedata file, change the numbers inside to match the ID of the stage in the codes.
